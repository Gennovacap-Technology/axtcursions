Down the hill on South Congress toward Downtown Austin.

I lived on South Congress for about a year. During the day it can be hellish for a cyclist. Despite the bike lanes, there's still lots of traffic and cars parked in that strange diagonal back-in-only manner adjacent to the bike lanes.

At night though, the street becomes a neon-shaded oasis of concrete crying to be used. I recommend after 3AM to avoid any drunk drivers. Go shopping during the day so you can see the full contrast.

Start just north of Magnolia Cafe on Mary St. Coast awhile as you pass Monkey See Monkey Do and Big Top Candy Shop. Build up some speed and fly through the sea of green (and red) lights on your way down the hill.

You may need to pause for a moment at the huge intersection Riverside, but try to time it so you hit it on green and maintain your momentum. You'll need it to get up the hill and onto the Congress St. bat bridge. Ride the bridge all the way over and stop at 1st. Hang a left onto the sidewalk/bike trail area. It will guide you along the river and onto the bike trail attached to the 1st St. bridge. Head back over the river.
