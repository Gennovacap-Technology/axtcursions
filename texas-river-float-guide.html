          <h2>How Tubing Works</h2>
          <p>Floating the river varies from river to river and between the different tubing outfitters. In general, they all have these features in common:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>BYOB</b></li>
            <li>You'll put your <b>drinks/snacks in a cooler</b>. Your cooler will get its own tube and you'll tie it to at least one person's tube in your group.</li>
            <li>You'll hop in a tube and float to your destination.</li>
            <li>Floating takes anywhere from <b>1-5 hours</b> depending on which river and which outfitter you go with.</li>
            <li>Tubing in Texas isn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewater">whitewater</a> rafting/canoeing/kayaking. It's much more tame and leisurely. You don't need a helmet or a paddle. However, you will encounter rapids, rocks, fast-flowing water, and deep areas where you aren't able to touch bottom.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Quick tips for all tubing</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI">Always <b>wear sunscreen</b></a></li>
            <li>Get a tube with a <b>drink holder</b>.</li>
            <li>Don't use a black tube for yourself. They get too hot in the sun. They're fine for your coolers though.</li>
            <li>Bring a <b>snack</b>. You'll end up wanting it about an hour before the trip ends.</li>
            <li>Leave your shoes/flip flops in your car. You'll probably lose them on the river. You might want to consider water shoes or sports sandals though - the river beds are rocky.</li>
            <li>If you don't want something to get wet, don't take it. <b>Everything will get wet.</b></li>
            <li>If you don't want to lose something, don't take it.</li>
            <li>Bring extra sunscreen with you on the trip so you can reapply it.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.dollartree.com/Max-Block-SPF-30-Sunscreen-Lotion-with-Aloe-Vera-4-oz-/p317780/index.pro">This Dollar Tree sunscreen</a> is just as good as others and is only <b>$1 for 4oz</b> (you'll usually pay $5+ for an 8oz tube). Perfect size to take on the river.</li>
            <li>Bring a waterproof camera if you want photos. Most of the "waterproof" phone cases aren't very good.</li>
            <li>Don't bring your phone. You'll probably lose it. If you do bring your phone, put it one of those aforementioned waterproof cases just for good measure.</li>
            <li>Put everything you don't want to get wet in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dry%20sack">dry sack</a>.</li>
            <li>Don't be a dick. Bring a <b>trash bag</b> for your empties and other trash.</li>
            <li>Have a <a href="4-bachelor-bachelorette-party-ideas-in-austin.html#bbq"><b>plan for where to eat</b></a> when you're done tubing.</li>
            <li>Have <a href="/river-float-tubing-austin.html">a <b>safe ride home</b></a>.</li>
            <li>Bring a hat and sunglasses.</li>
            <li><b>No glass</b> containers.</li>
            <li><b>No styrafoam</b>.</li>
            <li>If you're floating the Guadalupe, make sure you know <a href="http://wordcc.com/Water-Laws/WORD-Ordinances">all the rules</a>.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated! Bring water.</li>
          </ul>
