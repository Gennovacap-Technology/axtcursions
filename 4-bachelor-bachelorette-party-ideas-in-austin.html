      <h1>4 Bachelor/Bachelorette Party Ideas In Austin That Aren't Lame</h1>
      <p>Have a memorable, stress-free bachelor(ette) party with these 4 fun ideas in Austin, Texas.</p>

      <h2>1. River Tubing</h2>
      <a href="/river-float-tubing-austin.html"><img src="/images/tubing/bachelor-party-1.jpg" class="pull-right col-xs-12 rounded full-page-image"/></a>
      <p>Take a relaxing <a href="/river-float-tubing-austin.html">ride down the river on a tube</a>. It's not white water rafting and requires no skill. In fact, the river is shallow in most parts and since you have an inflatable tube with you, you don't even need to be a strong swimmer. Floating usually takes about 3-5 hours. Drink some beers and be merry with your best friends.</p>
      <p><b>Highlights:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>BYOB. Your cooler full of beer floats beside you.</li>
        <li>Cheap</li>
        <li>Keep cool in the river while you work on your tan</li>
        <li>Surround yourself with happy people =)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Brewery / Beer Tour</h2>
      <a href="/austin-brewery-tours.html"><img src="/images/beer-flight.jpg" class="pull-right col-xs-12 rounded full-page-image"/></a>
      <p>You could do the typical <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30196-d1863269-Reviews-6th_Street-Austin_Texas.html">6th street bar crawl</a>, but you'd be missing out on touring one of the nation's top cities (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/best-cities-beer/story?id=23383685#all">1</a>, <a href="http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-best-beer-cities/12">2</a>) for beer. Austin is home to <a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/30/">several breweries and tons of bars that love to sell local beer</a>. Start with a huge sampling of Texas beers at at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/craft-pride-austin">Craft Pride</a> on Rainey Street. Then head over to the East Side to sit at a picnic table, listen to great music, and play board games while you drink at <a href="http://www.hopsandgrain.com/sustainable-brewing/">sustainable</a> and friendly <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/hops-and-grain-austin-2">Hops and Grain</a>. Finally, head out and drink beers while you gaze at the scenic Texas Hill Country at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jester-king-brewery-austin-2">Jester King</a>. Take a <b><a href="/austin-brewery-tours.html">tour and do all three</a></b> to avoid making one of your friends into the designated driver.</p>

        <p><b>Highlights:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try out some of the best beer Texas has to offer</li>

      <h2>3. Shoot Guns</h2>
      <img src="/images/shotgun-on-chair.jpg" class="pull-right col-xs-12 rounded full-page-image"/>
      <p>Your friends back home may not believe you were in Texas without a photo of you and your friends shooting guns in boots and cowboy hats. Make a game out of it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeet_shooting">skeet shooting</a>. Clay targets fly into the air and you skillfully shoot them down. Or just spend some time on the range with pistols, shotguns and rifles. Here in Texas you can shoot a semi-automatic AR-15 or AK-47. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/reds-indoor-range-austin?osq=shooting">Red's Indoor Range</a> is the only range in city limits due to being granfathered in before regulations on shooting guns were passed. Also, no skeet shooting here due to being indoors. For an outdoor experience a little farther from the city center, we recommend <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/lone-star-gun-range-lockhart">Lone Star Gun Range</a> in Lockhart, TX.</p>
      <p><b>Highlights:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fun and competitive</li>
        <li>If you haven't done it before, it's educational</li>
        <li>Shoot guns that are possibly not legal in your home state</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Nothing says Texas like a giant plate of mouth-watering BBQ. Brisket, ribs, sausage - Austin has it all. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-salt-lick-bbq-driftwood">The Salt Lick</a> is BYOB and has both indoor and outdoor seating. The all-you-can-eat option lets you try as much as you want of all the meats and side dishes. If you're already in Lockhart to shoot guns, you could also check out (the non-BYOB) <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/blacks-barbecue-lockhart">Black's Barbecue</a>.</p>
