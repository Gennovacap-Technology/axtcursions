      <h1>6 Company Outing Ideas In Austin That Aren't Embarrassing</h1>
      <p>Team building. Images of stock photos with people whitewater rafting and doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_fall">trust falls</a> come to mind. Don't let your team outing be lame. Do something that people might actually like.

      <h2>1. Brewery / Beer Tour</h2>
      <a href="/austin-brewery-tours.html"><img src="/images/brewery-tour/brewery-tour-guys-small.jpg" class="pull-right col-xs-12 rounded full-page-image"/></a>
      <p>A <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30196-d1863269-Reviews-6th_Street-Austin_Texas.html">6th Street bar crawl</a> might be a bit heavy for a company outing. Plus you'd be missing out on Austin's amazing brewery scene, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/best-cities-beer/story?id=23383685#6">one of the top cities in the country for craft brewing</a>.  Relax at <a href="http://www.hopsandgrain.com/sustainable-brewing/">Austin-y and sustainable Hops &amp; Grain</a> then hang out with your teammates at the picturesque Hill Country brewery, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JesterKingBrewery/photos_stream?ref=page_internal">Jester King</a>.</p></p>

      <p><b>Highlights:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try out some of the best beer Texas has to offer</li>
        <li>Multi-brewery tours keep the atmosphere fresh and the party going</li>
        <li><a href="/austin-brewery-tours.html#private-tours">Easily paired with BBQ</a> and other food options</li>

      <a href="/river-float-tubing-austin.html"><img src="/images/tubing/bachelorette-party-tubing-1-small.jpg" class="pull-right col-xs-12 rounded full-page-image"/></a>
      <p>Relax with your teammates as you <a href="/river-float-tubing-austin.html">float the river</a>. No skills required for this non-competitive group activity. No dorky helmets or life vests either. In fact, the river is shallow in most parts and since you have an inflatable tube with you, you don't even need to be a strong swimmer. The float will usually last 3-5 hours. Coworker bonding while you relax in the water with cold drinks.</p>

        <li>Medium budget option</li>

        <li>BYOB, but alcohol is not required.</li>
