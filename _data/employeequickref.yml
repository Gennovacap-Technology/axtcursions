- ref: We don't do airport shuttles. The only transportation we provide is for our regular trips OR for groups of 10 or more. For example, we do not do one-off trips to Hamilton Pool for a group of 4 people.

- ref: Online booking for trips closes 1 hour in advance of when the trip leaves. We will take sign ups after that if there is space in the vehicle. Call Andrew (or the driver that day) to find out if there is space.
