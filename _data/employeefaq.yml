- q: How should I answer the phone?
  a: "ATXcurisons, (your name) speaking."

- q: What do I say if they ask about booking a private event?
  a: Yes, we do private events. I'll have our events coordinator get back in touch with you. Can I take your name and a phone number or email? How many people do you have and what activity were you looking to do (pub crawl, tubing, etc)?<br /><br />Then send an email with the details to <a href="mailto:info@atxcursions.com">info@atxcursions.com</a>
