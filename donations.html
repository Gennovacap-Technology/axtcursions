        <p>

        <h2>Two Ways to Donate</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><p>If the gift certificates for your event are issued <b>individually</b>, as you might do with door prizes, giveaway bags, and raffle items, ATXcursions is happy to cover the full cost of the donation.</p></li>

          <li><p>If you would like to issue gift certificates <b>two or more at a time</b>, as is common with an auction or silent auction for large ticket items or packages, ATXcursions asks that your organization contribute 30% of the value of the certificates. The donation from ATXcursions will be the remaining 70%.</p></li>
