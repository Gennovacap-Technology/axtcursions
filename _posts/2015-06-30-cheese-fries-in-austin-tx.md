Being from the midwest, I grew up with the delicious dish of french fries smothered in cheese sauce. It's a staple up north. Queso is the language of Austin and shredded cheese you'll find on plenty of other dishes. Unfortunately it's not the same as the creamy, non-spicy cheese sauces of the North. Dumping shredded cheese on top of french fries is *not* the same thing.

* **[Alamo Drafthouse](http://drafthouse.com/austin)** has three options: Loaded Fries, Green Chile Hatch Cheese Fries, Cheese Fries. All excellent.
* **[Wholly Cow](http://www.whollycowburgers.com/)** doesn't have it on their menu, but this place is probably the closest I've found to the type of cheese sauce I enjoy. Their Philly Cheese Fries are basically a [horseshoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_sandwich) without bread. In this list, my favorite type of fries - fresh cut, wide, crispy on the ends and soft through the middle. Very potato-heavy flavor rather than the crispy frozen fry flavor. Bonus: The South Lamar one is located in combination with a quirky convenience store with an interesting selection of beer, wine, and candy... among other things.
* **[Shake Shack](https://www.shakeshack.com/location/south-lamar-austin/)**: Creamy cheddar and american cheese blended over crinkle cut fries.
* **Steak 'n Shake**: Cheese fries, plain and simple. A mild nacho-like cheese that is usually served in a dipping cup on the side for your crispy shoestring fries.
