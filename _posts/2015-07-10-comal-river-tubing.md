River tubing on the Comal River in New Braunfels is a relaxed experience that is a more "urban" scene than on the Guadalupe or San Marcos rivers. Much of the river is lined by housing and there are paved pathways along the river in some parts. There's a fun tube chute at one point in the river that's a fun, and sometimes rough, ride. The float passes by the Schlitterbahn Water Park and you might see some folks fly by on the Skycoaster.

The crowd at the Comal is generally a bit less of a party scene than at the San Marcos river. Less university students and a more refined process make the Comal float a bit more of a controlled experience.

ATXcursions will take you from downtown Austin to the river. We float the San Marcos, Comal, or Guadalupe depending on river conditions. All the floats are fun regardless of the river we tube that day. All you need to do is bring drinks and your badass self! **[Book a trip today](https://atxcursions.rezdy.com/28617/river-tubing)**!
