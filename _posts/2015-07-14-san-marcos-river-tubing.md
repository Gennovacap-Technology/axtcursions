River tubing in San Marcos is a scenic, nature-filled experience. You're surrounded by cypress trees on a wide river. Go early enough in the day before the other floaters and you'll probably see turtles hanging out on logs. The river can get a bit rough in spots; watch for floating branches and rocks.

If you're going early-ish in the day, you'll have a relaxed, chill experience. Floats later in the day are more of a party atmosphere with a much more crowded river. San Marcos is home to Texas State University and river tubing here has a larger university-age crowd than the Guadalupe and Comal rivers.

ATXcursions will take you from downtown Austin to the river. We float the San Marcos, Comal, or Guadalupe depending on river conditions. All the floats are fun regardless of the river we tube that day. All you need to do is bring drinks and your badass self! **[Book a trip today](https://atxcursions.rezdy.com/28617/river-tubing)**!
