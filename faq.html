        <h2>What should I bring?</h2>
        <p>Check out the page for each trip to get details about items you should bring with you. We recommend bringing comfy shoes and a camera on every trip.</p>

        <h2>Should I book in advance?</h2>
          <p>Absolutely! We do not show up to hostels unless there is a booking. Also, we might run out of space. And then you wouldn't be able to go with us. And you would be very sad =(</p>

        <h2>Do you need my phone number?</h2>
          <p>No, but if there is a trip cancellation we will only be able to notify you of the cancellation via email.</p>

          <p>At this time we are not wheelchair accessible.</p>

        <h2>What if I only want to go one-way?</h2>
          <p>Please let your driver know and if you booked online, note it in the "Special Requirements" section of the booking form. We don't offer discounts for one-direction modifications to trips at this time.</p>

        <h2>How can I book?</h2>
          <p>Online or by phone.</p>

        <h2>What if the weather is bad?</h2>
          <p>ATXcursions still runs if there is rainy weather. In the event of catastrophically horrible weather, we will cancel a trip and refund your money.</p>
