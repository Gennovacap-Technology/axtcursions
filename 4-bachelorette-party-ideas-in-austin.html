      <h1>4 Bachelorette Party Ideas In Austin That Aren't Lame</h1>
      <p>You want your bachelorette party to rock. It should be memorable, not stressful. And there's no better destination for it than Austin, Texas.</p>

      <h2>1. River Tubing</h2>
      <img src="/images/tubing/group-2-2.jpg" class="pull-right col-xs-12 rounded full-page-image"/>
      <p>Take a relaxing <a href="/river-float-tubing-austin.html">ride down the river on a tube</a>. It's not white water rafting and requires no skill. In fact, the river is shallow in most parts and since you have an inflatable tube with you, you don't even need to be a strong swimmer. Floating usually takes about 3-5 hours. Drink some drinks and have a great time with your girls.</p>
      <p>Highlights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>BYOB</li>
        <li>Cheap</li>
        <li>Keep cool in the river while you work on your tan</li>
        <li>Surround yourself with happy people =)</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>2. Craft cocktail bar hopping</h2>
      <img src="/images/craft-cocktail.jpg" class="pull-right col-xs-12 rounded full-page-image"/>
      <p>You could do the typical <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30196-d1863269-Reviews-6th_Street-Austin_Texas.html">6th street bar crawl</a>, but we recommend at least starting off with a nice drink or two. Austin is home to several excellent craft cocktail bars. Just off of 6th, walk in and slide open a hidden-entrace bookcase to the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/firehouse-lounge-austin-3">Firehouse Lounge</a>.

      <p>Highlights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay classy. Optionally, get dressy</li>
        <li>Expect to pay $8-14 for a craft cocktail</li>
      </ul>
